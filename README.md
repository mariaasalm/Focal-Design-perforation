Future-Design-Perforation:
This project, developed for the printing company "Future Design" based in France, focuses on the perforation of images. It is part of a Project via Fiverr, entitled "Perforation of Images".

Requirements:
The project is designed and implemented using Python, with a graphical user interface (GUI) created through Qt Designer. To ensure the project runs smoothly on your system, you will need to install specific Python libraries. These libraries are crucial for handling image processing, PDF conversions, and the overall operation of the GUI.

Please execute the following commands in your terminal to install the required libraries:
      pip install opencv-python
      pip install imutils
      pip install pdf2image

GUI Overview:
The project's GUI is meticulously crafted using Qt Designer, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for perforating images. The backend coding, responsible for the functionality and logic of the perforation process, is also developed in Python, ensuring a seamless integration between the interface and the processing capabilities.

Below is a screenshot of the project's GUI, demonstrating its layout and design:
